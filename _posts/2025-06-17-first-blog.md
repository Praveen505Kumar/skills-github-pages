# My Markdown Example

This is a **simple** Markdown example.

Here are a few common elements:

* Item one
* Item two
    * Sub-item A  <-- Make sure these are standard spaces
    * Sub-item B  <-- Make sure these are standard spaces

You can also make text *italic* or ~~strikethrough~~.

Here's a [link to Google](https://www.google.com).
